Example 2:

TEXT:
"1984," a dystopian novel by George Orwell, was first published in 1949 and has since stood the test of time as a seminal work within the science fiction and political fiction genres. Orwell's chilling narrative introduces readers to a totalitarian world ruled by the Party and its enigmatic leader, Big Brother. The story follows Winston Smith, a man living in a repressive society where independent thought is a crime and surveillance is omnipresent. As Winston grapples with his inner longing for truth and freedom, the novel explores themes of censorship, surveillance, and the malleability of reality itself. Through his piercing critique of totalitarianism, Orwell warns of the dangerous potential for governments to manipulate truth and control its citizens, making "1984" a cautionary tale as relevant today as it was upon its release over seven decades ago.
